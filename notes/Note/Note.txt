Game Ideas:
	plant growing - multiple spots, juggle taking care of them
	spider-man - fast movement, momentum, spin with "rope"
	healer - healer in the center with heroes around being attacked by zombies, heal shield buff heroes
	weird movement platformer - move in a unconventional way insted of jumping (sword hoisting?)
	
Focus:
	5-10 minute gameplay
	intro/tutorial to explain the tools and objective
	show/explain EVERYTHING, no hidden components
	keep it simple, let everyone beat the game, maybe add different difficulty
