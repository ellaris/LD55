Game Ideas:
	plant growing - multiple spots, juggle taking care of them
	spider-man - fast movement, momentum, spin with "rope"
	healer - healer in the center with heroes around being attacked by zombies, heal shield buff heroes
	weird movement platformer - move in a unconventional way insted of jumping (sword hoisting?)
	
Focus:
	5-10 minute gameplay
	intro/tutorial to explain the tools and objective
	show/explain EVERYTHING, no hidden components
	keep it simple, let everyone beat the game, maybe add different difficulty

Theme: Summoning

[] Customize a witch (hat, hair, outfit, colors)
summon a familiar (cat, snake, raven, spider)
Draw a summoning shape (triangle, circle, hexagon, pentagram)
	[] check for similarity above 90% or redo it
summon candles (above the fireplace) around it (doesn't matter where)
	[] sometimes the candles fall sideways, summon them upright!
summon 15 gold coins (pouch beside fireplace) inside it 
	[](the coins can be finicky and summonning them 
		the first time makes them bouncy or rolly, summon them back inside if they go outside)
	[] you summon your credit card, you don't want to lose that, summon it back to your pocket!
summon herbs (hanging above the fireplace) inside the shape
summon fire to light the candles (from the fireplace)
	[] the fire has principles, you have to say preety please before it answers your summons (click the witch)
the summoning ritual takes 1 hour (transition)
	[] because of the courthouse next door a criminal gets summoned first, summon him inside the cage (beside 
	fireplace) before he escapes! (maybe the familiar does it if he gets too close outside)
	
	
[] minigame with familiar, maou-sama summons an undead army, it has to use it's summoning abilities to
	hold them back for 1 minute before the white wizard Randalf arrives with his riders
	[] whenever and undead dies two more get summoned around the area
	[] summon a falling meteor to wipe groups of undead
	[] summon an explosion to wipe all skeletons
	[] mana system, explosion 100%, meteor 10%, charge 5% per second
